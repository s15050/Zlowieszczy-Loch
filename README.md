# Zlowieszczy-Loch
A (Polish-language) adventure game created in a month as an end-of-semester project.

As Github does not allow for uploading more than 100 folders at a time (and because one cannot put folder into a folder on Github), the following folders and files have to be put into an Assets folder once downloaded: 

* Music
* Scenes
* Scripts
* Sprites
* Amatic-Bold
